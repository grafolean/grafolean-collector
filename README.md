# About Grafolean Collector Python library

This is a Python 3 library which helps build data collectors for Grafolean, an easy to use generic monitoring system. It only comes handy for _controlled_ (that is: non-_custom_) controllers, which are managed through Grafolean UI. Currently only Grafolean SNMP and Ping Collectors use this library.
